#### Junior Full Stack Web Developer 

I recently read a blog which said the no.1 skill required of developers in 2019 was curiosity. Well we all know what they say about curiosity. Good job I'm a human and not a cat, I thought. 

I've always been inately curious, but this accelerated infinitely when I started learning to code around 2 years ago. I am consumed by the idea that with code, I can never stop learning.

I ask 'why?' first, then 'how?'.

Being naturally adventurous and fascinated with diversity, I do my best to see all new opportuities, challenges and experiences as positive. It was this that helped me take the leap to join MAKERS - the no.1 software development bootcamp in Europe - despite a succesful career in sales and recruitment. I felt unfulfilled, that my learning had stagnated and that I wasn't contributing enough. Now I'm on a mission to design and build web applications that solve real problems and deliver a net positive to the world!

## Skills & Experience

#### Complex Problem Solving

The first thing that learning code has taught me is that all complex problems are solveable when approached correctly. I love the challenge of looking at a problem's component parts, formulating ideas about the best approach and selecting opportunities to solve small parts of the bigger problem.

#### Communication

I have frequently been told I'm an excellent communicator. In over 7 years working in client facing roles, I have honed these skills to get the best out of relationships with other humans. I believe great communication is as much about listening and asking good questions as it is about what I have to say. This allows me to make sure my input is valuable. I believe this makes me to be especially effective when pair programming and discussing code problems with colleagues.

#### Leadership 

In my role as Recruitment Manager at Little Ones UK, I gained significant experience as a leader. I had the opportunity to build a sales team from scratch and ended up with 13 reports. In this time I hired my own people, looked after P&L for the team and learned a whole lot about how to get the best out of people through effective collaboration. A good leader enables their team to maximise their potential and whilst there were many significant achievements in terms of financial targets in this time, I'd say my biggest achievement was developing people who worked for me to create similar opportunities for themselves.

#### Scaling 

At both Ntrinsic and Little Ones UK, I joined companies at an early stage looking to grow. This experience has taught me how to scale a business sustainably. I like to think about process and structure that allows growth to happen in he right way. This involves thinking about what that future vision looks like for both the business and the customer. I believe this philosophy is something that will help me greatly as a developer when working with tech products. For example, at Little Ones UK we were faced with difficulty retaining staff for longer than a year. We tackled this problem by completely re-structured remuneration and benefits for all employees, providing greater transparency about the opportunities and incentives available.
